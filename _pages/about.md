üéì Hello! I am Prakrit Tyagi, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, driven by a passion for robotics and innovation. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in the design of robotic software stacks, bug analysis, and problem-solving, complemented by hands-on experience in hardware robotics projects.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è With a keen interest in advancing technology, I have focused my studies and projects on controls, path planning, SLAM, and machine learning. I thrive in environments where creativity meets technical expertise, and I am eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges.

üíº I am currently seeking opportunities in robotics companies and startups where I can contribute to groundbreaking projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals.

Education
======
* **Carnegie Mellon University**            2022-2024
  * M.S. in Mechanical Engineering
  * GPA: 4.00/4.0 
* **Delhi Technological University**        2017-2021
  * B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering
  * GPA: 8.75/10.0 

<!-- Research Interests
======
I am focused on optimal control and simulations. I feel that learning based methods
could have eased my burden as they could be trained to learn the physical parameters of the physical system when I could have just focused on software implementation and left some hardware tasks to learning models. Sim2Real is also another pipeline that hopes to seamlessly transfer effort made on simulations to real world experiments, preventing embarrassments of multiple failures before success.  -->

Projects
======


### [Viewpoint-Conditioned Legible Motion Planning with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning](/portfolio/portfolio-5)
Implemented a universal planning architecture for learned legible behaviors using reinforcement learning and imitation learning.

### [Warebots: Multi Agent Path Finding](/portfolio/portfolio-1)

The project explores the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, focusing on one-shot MAPF and its dynamic counterpart, Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF). It delves into the Conflict-Based Search Algorithm (CBS), a two-level approach for resolving conflicts between agents, showcasing its effectiveness in small-scale environments inspired by the League of Robot Runners competition.

### [LQR based Thrust control of Quadcopter](/portfolio/portfolio-2)
Implemented an LQR controller, which is linearized depending on the quadrotor‚Äôs state, unifies the control of rotational and translational states, handles time-varying system dynamics, control parameters and does direct motor control.

### [Human Facial Emotion Recognition & Classification](/portfolio/portfolio-3)
As part of a semester-long machine learning team project, built a CNN model that could recognize and classify human emotions from facial images. The objective was to train the model to identify the emotion of a person from their faces.

### [Super Visual Lidar Odometry and Mapping](/portfolio/portfolio-4)
Implemented a robust real-time ROS-based framework for accurate trajectory estimation, 3D Mapping, and Localization by augmenting the feature extraction and matching algorithm with Super-Point descriptor and SuperGlue matching algorithm.
