title: "LQR based Thrust control of Quadcopter"
excerpt: "Implemented an LQR controller, which is linearized depending on the quadrotorâ€™s state, unifies the control of rotational and translational states, handles time-varying system dynamics, control parameters and does direct motor control. <br/><img src='/images/LQR.gif'>"

* Performed hover control in experiment.
* Showed the fundamental applicability
of state-dependent and, therefore, time-varying LQR control
on a MAV with real experiment.
* Below are results of the experiment.
