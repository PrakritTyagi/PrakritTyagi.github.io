## Description

This is a simple bot that can autonomously navigate unknown environments. It has a lidar, camera and wheel encoders for sensing and a differential drive for movement. The bot uses the ROS2 package NAV2 to move from one point to another while avoiding obstacles. It also uses the SLAM_TOOLBOX package to create a map of the environment.
