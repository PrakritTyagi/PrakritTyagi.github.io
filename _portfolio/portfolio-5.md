title: "Viewpoint-Conditioned Legible Motion Planning with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "Legibility is a crucial concept in terms of efficiency and trust in assistive robotics and human-robot collaboration, where the robot communicates its objectives through its actions in an understandable and predictable manner. Traditional motion planning techniques encounter various issues, including high computational latency, ambiguous objectives, and intensive tuning efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a universal planning architecture for learned legible behaviors using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a novel planning model that considers humanâ€™s viewpoint to generate adaptive motions that more effectively express intents. The effectiveness of our frameworks is validated through goal-reaching manipulation tasks conducted using the xArm6 robot in both simulated environments and real-world settings. Human-based evaluations indicate that our trained agent outperforms expert demonstrations by 15\%. <br/><img src='/images/xarm.gif'>"
