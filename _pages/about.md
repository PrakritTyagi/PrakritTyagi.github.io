### [Warebots: Multi Agent Path Finding](/portfolio/portfolio-1)

The project explores the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, focusing on one-shot MAPF and its dynamic counterpart, Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF). It delves into the Conflict-Based Search Algorithm (CBS), a two-level approach for resolving conflicts between agents, showcasing its effectiveness in small-scale environments inspired by the League of Robot Runners competition.

### [LQR based Thrust control of Quadcopter](/portfolio/portfolio-2)
Implemented an LQR controller, which is linearized depending on the quadrotor‚Äôs state, unifies the control of rotational and translational states, handles time-varying system dynamics, control parameters and does direct motor control.

### [Human Facial Emotion Recognition & Classification](/portfolio/portfolio-3)
Built a CNN model to recognize and classify human emotions from facial images as a part of a semester-long machine learning team project. The objective was to build and train a model that can identify the emotion of a person from its face. As a member of a five person team, I took charge of the data collection and preprocessing. Furthermore, I was responsible for the development, training, and evaluation of the CNN model.

### [Super Visual Lidar Odometry and Mapping](/portfolio/portfolio-4)
Implemented a robust real-time ROS-based framework for accurate trajectory estimation, 3D Mapping, and Localization by augmenting the feature extraction and matching algorithm with Super-Point descriptor and SuperGlue matching algorithm.
