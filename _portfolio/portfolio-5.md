title: "Viewpoint-Conditioned Legible Motion Planning with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "Legibility is a crucial concept in terms of efficiency and trust in assistive robotics and human-robot collaboration, where the robot communicates its objectives through its actions in an understandable and predictable manner. Traditional motion planning techniques encounter various issues, including high computational latency, ambiguous objectives, and intensive tuning efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a universal planning architecture for learned legible behaviors using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a novel planning model that considers humanâ€™s viewpoint to generate adaptive motions that more effectively express intents. The effectiveness of our frameworks is validated through goal-reaching manipulation tasks conducted using the xArm6 robot in both simulated environments and real-world settings. Human-based evaluations indicate that our trained agent outperforms expert demonstrations by 15\%. <br/><img src='/images/xarm.gif'>"

<!-- ## Approach:

The approach centers around the Conflict-Based Search Algorithm (CBS), a novel method for resolving agent conflicts. CBS operates on two levels: a high level that forms a search tree for conflicts and a low level that finds paths for individual agents. The report compares CBS with traditional pathfinding algorithms, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability in dynamic environments.

## Results:

Experimental results showcase CBS's performance in two different environments: a random map and a warehouse map. These tests reveal the algorithm's strength in handling complex multi-agent scenarios with minimal conflicts and delays. The warehouse map, simulating a real-world logistics scenario, particularly highlights CBS's practical applicability in managing dynamic agent paths efficiently. -->
