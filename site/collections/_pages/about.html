          <strong>📚 Fun fact:</strong> The dynabook was a portable computer concept first introduced by Alan C. Kay (American computer scientist) in the 1960s and 1970s. 
          Tetsuya Mizoguchi, an executive in Toshiba's mainframe computer division, read Kay's paper "Personal Dynamic Media" in the March 1977 IEEE Computer; 
          and inspired by the concept of a computer that could be carried and used by anyone of any age, Mizoguchi became determined to develop such a computer.
          The first Toshiba computer with the name DynaBook was announced on June 26, 1989.
